# Open Platform for Energy Networks (OPEN)

## Overview

Oxford University's Energy and Power Group's Open Platform for Energy Networks (OPEN) provides a python toolset for modelling, simulation and optimisation of smart local energy systems.
The framework combines distributed energy resource modelling (e.g. for PV generation sources, battery energy storage systems, electric vehicles), energy market modelling, power flow simulation and multi-period optimisation for scheduling flexible energy resources.

OPEN and the methods used are presented in detail in the following publication:

T. Morstyn, K. Collett, A. Vijay, M. Deakin, S. Wheeler, S. M. Bhagavathy, F. Fele and M. D. McCulloch; *"An Open-Source Platform for Developing Smart Local Energy System Applications”*; University of Oxford Working Paper, 2019


## Installation

python setup.py install

## Getting started

The simplest way to start is to duplicate one of the case study main.py files:
- OxEMF_EV_case_study_v6.py
- Main_building_casestudy.py
